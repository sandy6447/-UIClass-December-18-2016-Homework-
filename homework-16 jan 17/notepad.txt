Arrays:
	methods:
		--->forEach method
			it runs the loop for each every element in the array.
		Syntax: 
			array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
		example:
		
		--->Map method
        The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.
        The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order.
        Syntax: 
        array.map(function (current value, index, arr),thisValue)
 		
 		-->Reduce Method
 		The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.
		The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).
		The return value of the function is stored in an accumulator (result/total).
		Syntax:
		array.reduce(function(total, currentvalue,index,arr),thisValue.)

		-->sort Method
		it sorts the numbers or strings in an ascending order manner.
		Syntax:
		array.sort(CompareFunction)


JavaScipt Objects:
		3 different ways to create a javascript object:
			1) Define and create a single object, using an object literal.
            Example: 
            var person = {firstName:“Mick", lastName:“Moor", age:35};
            2) Define and create a single object, with the keyword new.
            Example:
            var person = new Object();
            person.firstName = “Mike";
            person.lastName = “Moor";
            person.age = 35;
           3) Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
           Example:
           function person(first, last, age, eye) 
           {   this.firstName = first;    
           this.lastName = last;   
            this.age = age;   
            this.eyeColor = eye;}
            var myFather = new person("Johny", “Moe", 20, "blue");
           var myMother = new person(“Aally", “Jones", 28, "green");

    properties:

    -----the values associated wit this object are the properties.
    Syntax: ObjectName.property
    Example:: person.age,
              person.lastName;

we can access the object property by calling its property
    person.age
we can add the property to  the object by specifying the property and its value.
   person.nationality = "indian";
   we can delete the property by using the delete keyword.
   delete person.age;
